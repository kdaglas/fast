# fastFoodfast

This is a food delivery service app for a restaurant that allows customers to make orders of their favorite meals they like. This app is hosted on: 
- [www.fastFoodfast.com](https://kdaglas.github.io/fastFoodfast/UI/index.html)

## fastFoodfast-api

The api allows the customers to post and get data from the app through API end points that are creating a connection of the client with the database. An customer can register and login to the app, order for a meal, view a single order made, view all the orders made, view their order history, update or modify or change a particular order they feel does not meet what they want and also view the menu with all the available meals. Whereas an administrator can login to the app, get the menu of the meals and add a food option to the menu.API is being hosted by heroku at:
